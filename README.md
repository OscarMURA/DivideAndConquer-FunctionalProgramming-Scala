## Integrating Task 1
**Terminal Objectives**.

**OT1**. Apply the functional paradigm in the analysis, design, evaluation, selection, and implementation of algorithms to provide solutions to problems whose structure is naturally self-contained.

**OT2**. Apply mathematical induction to define discrete structures, prove their properties and verify algorithms formally.

**OT7**. Express or communicate with appropriate/specialized vocabulary and language the main ideas about discrete structures or functional programming.

## Content
This repository contains the implementation of three algorithms using Scala and functional programming techniques covered in the course:

1. **Number of Inversions in a Sequence**: Implementation based on modifying the MergeSort algorithm.
2. **Improving QuickSort**: Redesign of the QuickSort algorithm using a three-way partition to handle sequences with repeated elements.
3. **Distributed Sorting with BucketSort**: Generic implementation of BucketSort and tests using a provided dataset.

## Repository Structure
- `src/main/scala`: Contains the implementation of the algorithms.
- `src/test/scala`: Unit tests for each of the algorithms.
- `doc/`: Project documentation, including test design, proofs, and complexity analysis.

## Implementation Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Scala
- **Paradigm**: Functional Programming
- **Data Structures**: Immutable
- **Methods**: Recursion and Pattern Matching
- **Annotation**: Recursive functions with iterative processes must be annotated with `@tailrec`.

## Submission Conditions
- The project must be on GitHub Classroom and adhere to the following deadlines:
  - First commit: Friday, March 9, 2024
  - Final submission: Monday, March 18, 2024
